Mindful Quest: A Mental Health App

Developed both the backend and frontend components for the project. For the backend, we used the Spring Boot framework to implement the REST APIs, and for the front end, we used Flutter. For the database, we used PostgreSQL. 
We implemented the following features.
Authentication: We implemented the sign-in, signup, and signout features using JWT authentication.
Home screen: After logging in, the user will be in the Home screen, where he can see the aggregated score chart daily and event lists.
Trivia: Users can play trivia questions regarding mental health.
Forum: Users can share their concerns in the forum to get help from others. For now, users can post and comment on a post.
Breathing: Users can exercise breathing to feel more calm.
Settings: From the settings page, users can change their username and password, change the app theme from dark to light mode, and log out.
